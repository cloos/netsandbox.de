I pushed version 0.02 of RT-Extension-ReminderImproved to [GitHub](https://github.com/cloos/RT-Extension-ReminderImproved).
It includes some changes and bug fix from BestPractical to the reminder function in RT 4.0.

As you could read before, the updates to the reminder function in this extension will be included in the upcoming RT 4.0 release.
