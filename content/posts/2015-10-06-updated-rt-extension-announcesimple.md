Version 1.00 of my extension allows Admins now to set a queue specific announce
message that is displayed on the ticket page.

You can edit the queue announce message as an RT user with the `AdminQueue`
right from `Admin > Queues > Announce`.

As always you can find the updated extension on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloos/RT-Extension-AnnounceSimple)
and [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::AnnounceSimple).
