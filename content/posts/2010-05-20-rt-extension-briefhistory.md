My second [Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker) extension
cleans up a little bit the ticket page. In the history you will only see
transactions from type create, correspond and comment. If you want to see the
full history you have to use the history link in the top menu. You can find the
extension at [GitHub](http://github.com/cloos/rt-extension-briefhistory).
