For those like me, who are waiting for Firefox for Android, you can read the
latest news about that at https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android
or https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android.

In the blog of one of the developers there are also some more information: http://blog.vlad1.com/2010/02/02/android-progress-more-pixels-edition/.
