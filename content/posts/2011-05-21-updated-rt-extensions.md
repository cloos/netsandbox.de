I just updated the [Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker)
extensions RT-Extension-Gravatar and RT-Extension-HistoryFilter to make sure
that they will work fine with RT 4.0.

The updated versions are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloos/) and
[CPAN](https://search.cpan.org/~cloos/).
