If you want to send your RT users a simple `RT will be down this saturday` message,
you can use my new RT-Extension-AnnounceSimple.

It will look like this:

You can edit the announce message as an RT admin user from `Admin > Tools > Announce`:

As always you can find the extension on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloos/RT-Extension-AnnounceSimple)
and [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::AnnounceSimple).
