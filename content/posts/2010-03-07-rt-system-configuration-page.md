The [Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker) System
Configuration Page (`Configuration > Tools > System Configuration`) didn't look
really nice. As I like fancy layouts, I put some of the information into tables
with the default RT layout (see the code [here](https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/59296a24ba28dfc0288baa02ea4fadb9621b8620)).

With this changes I _inspired_ Jesse Vincent to make the page look even more
beautiful by putting the information into nice boxes
(see the code [here](https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/d4ce16f62b4f8f004b68d1287cde96507201132b)).

To see the changes, get the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bestpractical/rt)
or wait for the next release (3.8.8).
