My [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) IMAP Server is running. The installation
was very simple, thanks to the great tutorial on https://workaround.org/ispmail.
So it is time to test some webmail clients. Candidates are [IMP](https://www.horde.org/apps/imp/),
[SquirrelMail](https://squirrelmail.org/) and [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net/).

If you know any other webmail client that is worth looking at, just leave me a message.
