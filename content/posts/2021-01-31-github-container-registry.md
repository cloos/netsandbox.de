As [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) announced a [Download rate limit](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/)
for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) images,
I now also publish by images on [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry):

<https://github.com/netsandbox?tab=packages>

I have also added a description how to use my [request-tracker](https://github.com/users/netsandbox/packages/container/package/request-tracker)
image for testing [RT](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker) extension with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions):
