This [Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker) extension is
an extended version of RT-Extension-BriefHistory where the user can select in
their preferences, which transaction types they want to see on the ticket
display page. You can find it as always at [GitHub](http://github.com/cloos/rt-extension-historyfilter).
