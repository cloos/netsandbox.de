## Debian

Your are currently on my private Debian project.
This is an virtual server hosted by <a href="http://www.strato.de/">Strato</a>.
I use this one to play a little bit with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/),
[Apache](https://www.apache.org/)", [PHP](https://php.net/) and
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)/[MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) and try out some
other software like web statistic and monitoring tools.

## Ubuntu

In April 2009 I got one of these new stylish netbooks. It's an MSI Wind U100.
And with my netbook I started to use [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) instead of
[Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows).

## Android

In July 2009 I ordered an HTC Hero mobile phone. I was very excited to try out
Android OS and the HTC Sense UI.

Update: I upgraded my HTC Hero to an HTC Desire.

## Request Tracker

I'm the admin of a ticketing system that my company uses.
We use the [Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker) from Best Practical.
You can find my contributions to the Request Tracker on [Github](https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commits?author=cloos).

I also created some RT extension. You can find them at [GitHub](https://github.com/cloos?tab=repositories&q=rt-extension)
and [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/CLOOS).
